    <p>Within the dusty bowels of South-eastern Uttar Pradesh, lies the quaint city of Varanasi. An enthralling expanse of antiquated structures that dot the left banks of Ganga River and surround the revered Kashi Vishwanath temple.
The brownish green waters of mighty Ganga flows through the vibrant city, infused with an aura of spirituality and magnetism.  The city is named in the most ancient texts known to mankind, the Vedas. It has witnessed the unending cycles of human birth and death, yet has preserved its own unique identity. 
There are 84 ghats in this fabled land, most built by kings and rulers of repute in the past three decades. Most ghats lead to ancient Havelis, Mansions or Palaces where men have spent their last few days on earth. Those who breathe their last within the corners of the blessed land and are cremated on riverside are believed to achieve “moksha”, the salvation that finally frees you from series of births and rebirths. 
The city presents as a celestial tapestry, embellished by around 2500 temples, many that have existed beyond when men even started recording time. Most well-known among them is Kashi Vishwanath, which beholds within it, one of 12 Jyotirlinga, where the all-pervasive and powerful lord Shiva presents as column of light.  Surrounding it are multiple shrines dedicated to various Hindu deities, coexisting with Islamic places of worship.</p>
<p>The way from the banks to main street is dotted by narrow alleyways.  Surrounding the pathways are buildings. Some of them are dilapidated and torn down, but they are interspersed with modern structures that have sprung in recent times mainly to house visitors and tourists. The city holds within its womb, around 2 million populace.  Varanasi does not sleep and there is an interesting ecosystem that coexists within its limits. Cows, dogs and cats roam around in gay abandon, sometimes littering the street with their excrement.  Sadhus and men with spiritual leanings are seen on ghats immersed in meditative trance or engaged in religious activities. You can hear the holy chime of temple bells and the chants from ancient texts reverberating in the air.  The city is up before the crack of dawn, with men and women crowding on the banks, to immerse themselves in the calming waters of the holy river. They say mighty mother Ganga is benevolent and kind enough to absolve the sins of all the fortunate men who are able to take holy dips in the river. The boatmen start lining up around the same time to take you on a ride of a life time. You can watch the yellow golden hues of the first sun rays break in eastern skies to drench the city in a curtain of celestial light. No words can ever express the profoundness of that experience, but it does connect you with a deeper sense of oneself and makes you question the futility of materialism in this ephemeral world. 
As the boat cruises through the river, you can view the glowing embers and flames licking from the funeral pyres set up on the banks of Harishchandra and Manikarnika Ghat. Piles and piles of wood are stacked on the steps and remains of fortunate departed ones are bought to rivershore to embark on their onward journey to heaven.  Sun god salutations and Aarti are offered in an elaborate Subah e Benares ceremony. 
Varanasi evenings are all about Ganga Aarti. The elaborate ceremony, replete with flowers, lights lamps and holy chants is held in Dashavamedh ghat. The almost one hour long aarti ceremony honouring and celebrating the holy river, tags at your hearts strings and transports you to state of spiritual bliss.  The young agile priests handle thousand wicked lamps with precision and experience, as they rotate it with one hand around them and offer their collective obeisance to “Ganga Mata” amidst chants and songs that are aired aloud. Thousands of folks witness this ceremony on ghats and boats. 
Another hallmark of Varanasi is the amazing culinary attractions of the city. From the uniquely crispy malai toast at Laxmi Chaiwala, to the crunchy Kachori with Chana at Ram Bhandar, the frothy rich drink at blue lassi, the complex textures of thandai, and the exclusive selection of sweet and tangy chats…it is just a magical dance on your tastebuds.  There is a  small shop that sells an amazing “Choti Kachori” at Manikarnika Ghat. It is a mind numbing sight to watch people folk to his shop while bodies are taken to the ghat for the final rites in front of it.  The distinction between life and death is blurred in Varanasi, both are celebrated with the same enthusiasm.  The city captivates  you …you experience  with all your senses, the sights, sounds, smells, taste and touch.</p>
<p>This is an enchanting blessed city, wrapped in mystery, draped in antiquity, drenched in spirituality that withstood the assault of time and holds the distinction of being a place older than time itself.   Varanasi is not just a place to visit but an experience to savour.</p>
